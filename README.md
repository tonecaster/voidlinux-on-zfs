Voidlinux on ZFS related stuff


This is just my personal repo as an attempt to install voidlnux on zfs that actually works. I've tried many different installs but most will fail on the "dracut" part, or are not suitable to my needs, which would be something more similar to the way "Trident Linux" used for installation.

Comments and collaboration are welcome!
